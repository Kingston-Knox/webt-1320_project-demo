                <p id=ph1>In this guild we have one job, take comissions from you to either capture or destroy any pests that may bother you; no matter the size nor magic we will send what we can to your aid!... for a price of course. We do our best to uphold our best behavior when not in battle, like say when you are in need of an escort to the next town over. With that said we are no monstors ourselfs, we will attempt to dispatch any beasts as humainly as we can, in the event that said monstor is to perish you hold the rights to do what you wish with it's remains.</p>
